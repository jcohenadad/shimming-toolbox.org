# PhaseDerivativeVariance

**Filetype:** _MATLAB&reg; function_

**Synopsis:** _%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%_

PhaseDerivativeVariance creates a phase quality map by
computing the variance of the partial derivatives of the
locally unwrapped phase. This is then used
to guide the phase unwrapping path. Uses only the 4 nearest
neighbours. The user may also input a binary mask.

# QualityGuidedUnwrap2D_EAO

**Filetype:** _MATLAB&reg; function_

**Synopsis:** _%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%_

QualityGuidedUnwrap2D implements 2D quality guided path following phase
unwrapping algorithm.

Technique adapted from:
D. C. Ghiglia and M. D. Pritt, Two-Dimensional Phase Unwrapping:
Theory, Algorithms and Software. New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1998.

Inputs: 1. Complex image in .mat double format
          2. Binary mask (optional)          
Outputs: 1. Unwrapped phase image
           2. Phase quality map

This code can easily be extended for 3D phase unwrapping.
